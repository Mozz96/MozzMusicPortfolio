                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Whether you’re just joining in or already beginning your journey, welcome back! Jeremy here, always creating, sometimes writing, but never napping on the job!  </p><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/sleepingnote.png" alt="sleeping music note" class="center-blog-images" width="400px"><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular" style="text-align: center;"><i>Ok, maybe that last part was a lie…</i></p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Last time, we went over introductions and the very basics of what it means to be a composer, like your goals in pursuing this profession, and the basics of what we’ll be going over in the future. Today, we’ll begin our journey proper with the first section of this series: what it means to create music in the modern age of the internet, and choosing your Digital Audio Workspace! </p><br><br>
                <h2 class="metrophobic-regular"><b>Being Online, Musically</b></h2><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">The world became increasingly online; before the internet, the barriers to creating music were rather steep. Whether you were a solo artist or an ensemble, you either had to get lucky by getting a record deal or paying exorbitant amounts of money to rent a recording booth, print copies of your music, then sell them yourself.</p><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/stockstudioroom.jpeg" class="center-blog-images" alt="studio" width="400px"><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pictured: An Average Studio Room. Professional, but Expensive.</i></p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">However, thanks to advances in technology and the internet, the barriers of entry to composing and publishing music are practically nonexistent; that’s how I got my start, I personally grew up on the internet, and through it I also learned the methods of creating music independently, efficiently, and far cheaper than recording in a traditional studio. Thanks to the internet, you’re well on your way to doing it as well!</p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Just a few examples of using the internet to your advantage are:
                    <ul>
                      <li class="metrophobic-regular">Uploading your creations to a platform like YouTube or Spotify</li>
                      <li class="metrophobic-regular">Creating a social media presence to interact with your newfound fans</li>
                    </ul>
                </p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Before you can do any of that though, you’ll need to know about the most common method of composing in the modern age: using what we call a Digital Audio Workspace.</p><br><br>
                <h2 class="metrophobic-regular"><b>Picking Your Digital Audio Workspace</b></h2><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/flstudioworkspace.png" alt="flstudio workspace" class="center-blog-images" width="400px"><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular" style="text-align: center;"><i>[Pictured: The Interface of one Digital Audio Workspace, FL Studio.]</i></p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">So, what’s a Digital Audio Workspace, often shortened to DAW, you may ask? Think of it as your all-in-one music creation station, combining your instruments, your recording and mastering software, and even sheet notation software. With a DAW, you can record music yourself or utilize MIDI to craft your songs exactly as you’d like! Using one is the best way to compose nowadays, and I have a few recommendations that can help you get started.</p><br>
                <h3 class="metrophobic-regular"><i><b>Just A Few Choices</b></i></h3><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular" style="text-align: center;"><i><b>GarageBand</b></i></p><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/garagebandlogo.png" alt="garageband logo" class="center-blog-images" width="400px"><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">GarageBand is a free and full-fledged DAW developed by Apple, exclusive to Apple devices. Despite it being a free program, this suite of music creation tools is nothing to scoff at: it boasts a large library of stock instruments, plug-ins, and modifiers to help get used to creating in a digital setting. If you own an iPhone or Mac, you may already have GarageBand installed, so I highly recommend you giving it a shot!</p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular" style="text-align: center;"><i><b>Cakewalk by BandLab</b></i></p><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/cakewalkbybandlab.png" alt="cakewalk logo" class="center-blog-images" width="400px"><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Cakewalk is another free DAW, developed originally by Cakewalk Inc but more recently BandLab Technologies, exclusively for Windows devices. While this DAW doesn’t boast a large number of instruments or plug-ins, it is a perfect starting point for those of you who want to dive in and record without buying in immediately. I started with Cakewalk, and speaking from experience, playing around with this program will help familiarize yourself with a DAW’s general layout and abilities.</p><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular" style="text-align: center;"><i><b>GarageBand</b></i></p><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/flstudiologo.png" alt="flstudio logo" class="center-blog-images" width="400px"><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Developed by Image-Line, FL Studios is a paid DAW for both Mac and Windows. Although it is a steep price, I can’t recommend FL Studio enough; it feels versatile and easy to learn, with a plethora of built-in instruments and plug-ins, and free major updates for the lifespan of the product. If you feel ready to move to the next step when recording music, you can’t go wrong with this one! </p><br><br>
                <h2 class="metrophobic-regular"><b>The Coda</b></h2><br><br>
                <img src="assets/photos/codapicture.jpg" class="center-blog-images"><br><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Simply posting your music on the internet is an achievement in and of itself! However, that’s not to say it’ll be a cakewalk (not the DAW!) though; being an independent composer means you have to take advantage of every advantage you can get to publish your music and potentially gain a following. To grasp the full potential of the internet, you have to look for opportunities to get yourself out there, the same as you would in the real world. We’ll be covering this in the future, but carving your niche online and building your fanbase is integral to any composer that wants to get their name out there, especially if you want to monetize your music.</p><br>
                <p class="metrophobic-regular">Next time, we’ll be getting a little more philosophical in our journey, thinking about our place as musicians. For now, never stop creating my fellow composers, I'll see you at the next stop on your journey.</p><br><br>
