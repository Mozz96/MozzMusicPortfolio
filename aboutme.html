                 <p class="metrophobic-regular">My name is Jeremy, mostly known online by my alias Mozz! I'm a musician and composer based in San Antonio Texas, with nearly 20 years of experience playing music. My goal for music composition is to immerse the listener in the emotion and theme of every piece with an eclectic range of genres and instruments, and to one day compose pieces for video games!</p><br>
                 <p class="metrophobic-regular">My music journey began back in 2006 when I first learned to play the piano at the age of 10, gradually getting more and more excited about music! During my teen years, I was a marching band kid, and there I learned how fun it was to play drums and various other percussion instruments, while also refining my piano skills further; I'd say that's when the seed was planted that grew into my dream of playing music for a living in some form.</p><br>
                 <p class="metrophobic-regular">In December 2022, I graduated from university with a Bachelor's degree in business, and an Associate degree in game development along the way. Wanting to use what I've learned to one day enter the game industry, I was left wondering how I can bridge those two skillsets together: "How can I use what I've learned to achieve this dream of mine?" After much reflection, it finally hit me: with the knowledge I gained in various fields and my passion for music, I'll become a composer and create music for people to enjoy!</p><br>
                 <p class="metrophobic-regular">In 2023, I began my journey as composer in earnest, writing pieces and demos in Cakewalk before moving to FL Studio, which has become my main workspace. Presently, I continue working on music whenever possible, always looking to improve and try new things with my pieces!</p>
